# PSS
This project aims to develop and implement a Web Application Vulnerability Scanner (WAVS) for an Android device such as a cell phone or tablet that focuses on detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities. This tool, Portable SQL injection Scanner or PSS, will assist the user by informing them of any SQL injection vulnerabilities present on the target website they wish to use.
